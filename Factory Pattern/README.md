# Factory Design Pattern

This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. The factory pattern separates the implementation details of creating objects from the common interface that allows users to generically use the object.
